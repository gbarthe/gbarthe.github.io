<h1>Gilles Barthe</h1>

	  <p> I am scientific director at <a href="http://www.mpi-sp.org/">Max
	  Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a>, Bochum,
	  Germany and a part-time research professor
	  at <a href="http://software.imdea.org/">IMDEA Software
	  Institute</a>, Madrid, Spain.

	    My research interests include programming languages and
	    program verification, software and system security,
	    cryptography, privacy, and mathematical logic. My most
	    recent research develops program verification techniques
	    for probabilistic programs, with a focus on relational
	    verification and its applications to cryptography,
	    differential privacy and machine learning.  </p>


	  <p> Previously, I was affiliated with IMDEA Software
             Institute, Spain (2008-); INRIA Sophia-Antipolis
             Méditerranée, France (1999-2008); University of Minho,
             Portugal (1998-1999); Chalmers University, Sweden
             (1997-1998); CWI, Netherlands (1995-1997); University of
             Nijmegen, Netherlands (1993-1995); University of
             Manchester, UK (1990-1993).  I received a Ph.D. in
             Mathematics from the University of Manchester, UK, in
             1993, and an Habilitation à diriger les recherches in
             Computer Science from the University of Nice, France, in
             2004.</p>
